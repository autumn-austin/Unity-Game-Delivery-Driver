# Unity Game Delivery Driver
 Simple Unity Delivery Driver Game

 To begin playing this game, you will need to download Unity editor.

 You are a car, Marty McFly, and you drive around delivering packages that have been lost to the customer. 

 The packages are indicated as brown sprites, the customer is a green sprite, and the yellow capsule sprite is a boost!

 Drive over the boosts for speed increases, but be careful if you run into anything! It will slow down your speed!

 Thanks for playing, happy coding.
